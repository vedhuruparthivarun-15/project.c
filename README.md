1. Abstract:
The Player Profile Management System is a simple C-based application developed to store,
 manage, and update player information efficiently. It allows users to add new players, view
 all players, search specific players using their ID, update player details, and delete
 unwanted records. The system is menu-driven and demonstrates the use of structures,
 arrays, and basic file handling concepts in C. This project helps beginners understand data
 organization and modular programming.
